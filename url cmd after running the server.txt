when this url ("http://127.0.0.1:8000/") comes then type after the url like this(" http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/")
after making this you will get the website whefre u can create delete display retrive 

so ensure that you are entering the correct command  


when you guys delete the id then u get the message as some like this "are you sure wanna delete the blog" in this 
if click yes then the blog will be deleted if not it will not get deleted automatically,

when you guys delete the blog then you can ensure where whether the id is deleted or not in this u should 
type the url something like this "http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/"put the id number which you have deleted"/ then click enter 
you can see the page called" blog retrive update delete"
